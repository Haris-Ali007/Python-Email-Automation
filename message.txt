Respected Sir,
Assalam o alaikum!! Hope so you are doing good and this email finds you well. Sir, I am writing this email on the behalf of undergraduate students of all sessions, requesting you to conduct our final exams online...
There are a lot of reasons behind this motive of ours and a few important points are presented here below:

1- The most important reason was the poor internet connection during our online studies. As you are well aware, strength of internet is not up to par in backward areas of Pakistan. Students found it difficult to concentrate on their online lectures as the internet connection often gets limited or distorted.

2- Students of northern areas, Southern Punjab and Balochistan faced much worst condition in that regard.

3- Sir, the thing is students are not considering themselves ready for these physical exams. They don't have such grip on these subjects that one must have to tackle the challenges of physical exams. Neither the students nor the teachers focused on the numerical portion of the subjects.

Sir it's a sincere request to please conduct our exams online this time. Physical exams will be a much burden on the students and I don't think that they will be able to tackle that. 
Hoping that this period of pendamic will end soon and things will come to normalty. We will be highly thankful for your consent in this regard
Yours sincerely,
Students of UET TAXILA
